        <h1 class="fb">Facebook</h1>  
        <p>The world's most popular social networking web site, Facebook enables users to connect with friends and family by sharing status updates, personal photos and other items of interest. Founder Mark Zuckerberg created Facebook in 2004 while a student at Harvard, designing the site as a means for other university students to communicate and to socialize online. The idea quickly spread from there and has become a global phenomenon, with more than 160 million users in the United States alone. Learning to leverage Facebook's popularity can prove beneficial to your small business.</p>

        <h1 class="ig">Instagram</h1>
        <p>Instagram is a free, online photo-sharing application and social network platform that was acquired by Facebook in 2012. Instagram allows users to edit and upload photos and short videos through a mobile app. Users can add a caption to each of their posts and use hashtags and location-based geotags to index these posts and make them searchable by other users within the app. Each post by a user appears on their followers' Instagram feeds and can also be viewed by the public when tagged using hashtags or geotags. Users also have the option of making their profile private so that only their followers can view their posts.</p>

        <h1 class="twt">Twitter</h1>
        <p>Twitter is a social networking and microblogging online service that allows users to send and receive text-based messages or posts of up to 140 characters called "tweets." After the online sign-up process, users can post their tweets by using a computer or other Twitter-compatible device such as a smartphone, and can view tweets posted by other "followed" users. Twitter is also referred to as the SMS of the Internet because of its unmatched popularity and its similarity to the SMS text messaging system used on cellphones. Twitter has been used to inform people about various TV events such as the Oscars, MTV Video Music Awards, etc. Because of this, Twitter is sometimes called the virtual watercooler or social television.</p>
